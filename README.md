### Project Description
This project is a landing page for a dental studio created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a hybrid approach by combining open-source technologies with private software components. The landing page allows users to:
- Call the clinic directly
- Schedule appointments via Google Calendar API
- Contact the clinic through WhatsApp

### Live Demo
